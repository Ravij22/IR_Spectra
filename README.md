# IR_Spectra
 Virtual lab for infrared spectroscopy


Infrared spectroscopy (IR spectroscopy or vibrational spectroscopy) is a technique used to study and identify chemical substances or functional groups in solid, liquid, or gaseous forms. It deals with the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum and can be analyzed in three ways: by measuring reflection, emission, and absorption. The major use of infrared spectroscopy is to determine the functional groups of molecules, relevant to both organic and inorganic chemistry.

We have developed an vitual lab for students to learn about IR spectroscopy. The lab includes the aim, principle, methodology and shows the characteristic graph for many compounds to help us identify the functional groups present in them.

We have also designed a quiz for students so they can check their progress.The quiz has 3 levels of difficulties(easy, medium and hard) and shows us our score at the end of the quiz.

# Usage

Once the website is up and running, you can use it as an e-commerce platform. Here are some key features and functionalities:

- User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts and log in.
- Aim and theory: Students can understand the aim of the practical and concepts related to IR Spectroscopy on this page.
- Quiz/Test: Students can take tests of different difficulty levels and assess their understanding of the concept based on the scores.
- Simulation: Students can carry out the practical virtually with the help of the simulator for better clarity. 
- Graph visualization: Students can select a compound from a list of compounds and its IR Spectroscopy graph will be visible on the screen along with the functional groups present in the compund. Students can then analyze the graph and understand the concept.

Feel free to explore the website and test its various functionalities.
